## Pronouns

| CL | English    |
|----|------------|
| vi | this, it   |
| ca | that, they |

There are only two root pronouns, **this** *(vi)* and **that** *(ca)*. We can modify both root pronouns to make them first and second person personal pronouns.

| CL | English    |
|----|------------|
| vina | I, me, my|
| cana | You      |

If we would like to pluralize our roots, we can do so by adding a pluralizing suffix (r).

| vinar | we, us  |
| canar | them    |
