# What is Project CL?

Project CL is currently an unnamed Constructed Language. A phonology (sounds) was selected, then put into a program which generated correctly structured words. Once generated, they were assigned a translation (automatically). Grammar is then worked on after word generation, and words are added and removed to make the grammar more realistic and functional. The grammar is currently similar that of Korean and Japanese.
